Hi again!

In the recent month I worked part time on a project of mine called internally [sobituaries](https://nekrologi.soiree.tech).

The site is totally in Polish and the purpose of it is to share obituary notices.

The notices cost 5.00 PLN and are paid with Stripe.

The technologies used are mostly Python, Django, DRF, Javascript, jQuery.

Go ahead and see a sample obituary to sense if it's worth anything:

[Sample obituary notice](https://nekrologi.soiree.tech/api/cemetery-registers/sample/obituary-notices/sample/sample/).
