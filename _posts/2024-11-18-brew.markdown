I use MacOS since 2017 and I like to sometimes grab something from the
Linux ecosystem. And there is [brew](https://brew.sh).
The most basic commands for it are doctor, install, uninstall, and upgrade.

```shell
brew doctor
brew install ${package_name}
brew uninstall ${package_name}
brew upgrade
```
